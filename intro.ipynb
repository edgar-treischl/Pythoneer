        "I tried to learn Python several times. Once I had a very peculiar class in which we should learn Python for processing natural language. Well, it was more about text mining than applying Python. I tried to learn Python with the help of several books which introduced all the ins and outs of Python. Before I started to learn Python the first time, I fluently spoke several other statistics software languages like R or Stata. I had basic skills in other languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I wrote my PhD with LaTeX. Coding and programming languages were not new for me, but still I failed to learn Python.\n",

        "It is really a shame, since I consider myself a tech-savvy without having the heavy programming background, but with a lot of fun learning new things and enjoy coding. Well, at least, if we get some results. For this reason I started this website. I was sick of reading books about Python without having the impression that I learn what I should learn to improve my skills. This impression could also be due to my educational background. I know what a function is, what a loop does, and have some background in statistics, even though the latter is limited since I am home in the social sciences.\n",

If you want to learn Python to automate processes, learn some statistical procedures from the scratch, or use Python to program some games, this website will not help you in any way. However, you do wanna transfer your knowledge from other languages like R, if you are familiar with multivariate (non-) linear regression techniques or do you have background in empirical social science, than this website might help you transfer your knowledge to Python. Let be give you an example why I started this website.\n",

Well, shit happens, don’t you think? I really started to get the creep as I reached a statistics section. Let’s see what I learned from this chapter.\n",
