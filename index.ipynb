        "The Pythoneer book is work in progress and at a very early stage. The goal is to provide a guide for R users to transition into Python. The project is open-source and contributions are welcome. There are several reasons why it can be beneficial for R users to learn Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Versatility: While R is a great language for statistical analysis and data visualization, Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wider variety of tasks, such as web development, machine learning, and scientific computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Large and active community: Python has a larger and active community, which means that there are a lot of resources and support available if you run into problems or want to learn new things.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Popularity in industry: Python is widely used in industry, particularly in areas such as data science and machine learning, so learning Python can make you more competitive in the job market.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integration with other tools: Python has many libraries and packages that allow it to integrate with other tools, such as databases, big data frameworks, and cloud computing platforms, making it a flexible and powerful tool for data analysis and computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Different approaches to problem-solving: R and Python have different approaches to problem-solving and data analysis, so learning both can expand your skill set and enable you to tackle a wider range of problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter aims to provide you with a brief overview of the book. We will discuss the motivation behind this book, the target audience, and the structure of the book. Formost, I try to outline how you can transfer your R knowledge to Python. \n",
        "\n",
        "What is my motivation to write this book? I tried to learn Python with the help of several books and classes. Coding and programming languages were not new for me, but still I failed to learn Python. I consider myself a tech-savvy without having a heavy programming background, but a lot of fun learning new things and enjoy coding. For this reason I started this book. If you want to learn Python to automate processes, apply statistical procedures from the scratch, or use Python to program games, this book will not help you in any way. However, you do wanna transfer your R knowledge, this book might be right choice. Thus I assume you have some basic knowledge of R and programming skills and there is no need to explain basic concepts such as loops, functions, or data types.\n"

Say we use the seaborn package because it provides us with some data. We can use the mpg data set as cars and fool around with it.

Guess what the next code does? And I guess you will skip the code after line 2, well thatâ€™s what recommend since the code only illustrates my point.
